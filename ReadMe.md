# Grocery List App

A minimalistic web application to help you create and manage your grocery shopping lists.

## How It Works

Making an accurate grocery list can be difficult when you overlook items because empty containers have been thrown away. Grocery List solves this problem by helping you maintain a master list you can reference.
